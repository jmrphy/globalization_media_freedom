abstract = {This article analyzes the effect of trade liberalization on employment and wages in the Mexican manufacturing sector. The study documents that many of the rents generated by trade protection were absorbed by workers in the form of a wage premium. Trade liberalization affected firm‐level employment and wages by shifting down industry product and labor demand. This in itself may have accounted for a 3%--4% decline in real wages on average. But trade reform also reduced the rents available to be captured by firms and workers. This had an additional negative effect on firm‐level employment and wages.},

abstract = {International relations are generally understood as a realm of anarchy in which countries lack any superior authority and interact within a Hobbesian state of nature. In Hierarchy in International Relations, David A. Lake challenges this traditional view, demonstrating that states exercise authority over one another in international hierarchies that vary historically but are still pervasive today. Revisiting the concepts of authority and sovereignty, Lake offers a novel view of international relations in which states form social contracts that bind both dominant and subordinate members. The resulting hierarchies have significant effects on the foreign policies of states as well as patterns of international conflict and cooperation. Focusing largely on U.S.-led hierarchies in the contemporary world, Lake provides a compelling account of the origins, functions, and limits of political order in the modern international system. The book is a model of clarity in theory, research design, and the use of evidence. Motivated by concerns about the declining international legitimacy of the United States following the Iraq War, Hierarchy in International Relations offers a powerful analytic perspective that has important implications for understanding America's position in the world in the years ahead.},

But in the years leading up to her leap into the fray, Meinhof was known throughout Europe as a respected journalist, who informed and entertained her loyal readers with monthly magazine columns. What impels someone to abandon middle-class privilege for the sake of revolution? In the 1960s, Meinhof began to see the world in increasingly stark terms: the United States was emerging as an unstoppable superpower, massacring a tiny country overseas despite increasingly popular dissent at home; and Germany appeared to be run by former Nazis. Never before translated into English, Meinhof's writings show a woman increasingly engaged in the major political events and social currents of her time. In her introduction, Karin Bauer tells Meinhof's mesmerizing life story and her political coming-of-age; Nobel Prize--winning author Elfriede Jelinek provides a thoughtful reflection on Meinhof's tragic failure to be heard; and Meinhof 's daughter---a relentless critic of her mother and of the Left---contributes an afterword that shows how Meinhof's ghost still haunts us today.},

In contrast, a political explanation of welfare state development in Chile and Mexico emphasizes the persistent differences in models of social provision. Mexico has used means-tested consumption subsidies and measures to correct market failures affecting the poor, while Chile used an asset redistribution and universal entitlement approach before 1973 and quasi-universal but modest consumption subsidies after 1990. Three political variables-competitiveness of the party system, organization of the poor, and alliance patterns-account for differences in welfare regime outcomes and are framed by the structural and ideational constraints of the prevailing developmental model.},

Rather, the conventional wisdom that FDI and respect for human rights are inherently contradictory has persisted. Instead, we posit that respect for human rights may encourage FDI. To examine this issue, we assess the direct effects of human rights upon FDI as well as the extent to which human rights indirectly affects FDI through its impact upon human capital. Using a system of simultaneous equations, we find respect for human rights to have a positive impact upon FDI.},

abstract = {This article examines the causes for the rise of political scandals in Argentina in the early 1990s. Available explanations fail to provide a satisfactory answer, mainly because they ignore the interplay of forces that produce media revelations of government wrongdoing. Argentine scandals cannot be reduced to arguments about official corruption but rather require a consideration of political and media developments. Media expos{\'e}s in Argentina have resulted from particular political dynamics coupled with the increasing opposition of some news media to the Menem administration. Political dynamics such as democratic stability, a strong executive, and the weakness of political parties as policymaking and communication institutions have contributed to reinforcing the role of the press as an alternative arena for acting out political confrontations. The fact that two dailies have adopted a muckraking ethos and conducted investigative reporting, unusual for Argentine media standards, also accounts for the growing centrality of the press in mediating political battles.

We survey the vast terrain of 'culturomics,' focusing on linguistic and cultural phenomena that were reflected in the English language between 1800 and 2000. We show how this approach can provide insights about fields as diverse as lexicography, the evolution of grammar, collective memory, the adoption of technology, the pursuit of fame, censorship, and historical epidemiology. Culturomics extends the boundaries of rigorous quantitative inquiry to a wide array of new phenomena spanning the social sciences and the humanities.},

abstract = {Before there was money, there was debt Every economics textbook says the same thing: Money was invented to replace onerous and complicated barter systems---to relieve ancient people from having to haul their goods to market. The problem with this version of history? There's not a shred of evidence to support it. Here anthropologist David Graeber presents a stunning reversal of conventional wisdom. He shows that for more than 5,000 years, since the beginnings of the first agrarian empires, humans have used elaborate credit systems to buy and sell goods---that is, long before the invention of coins or cash. It is in this era, Graeber argues, that we also first encounter a society divided into debtors and creditors. Graeber shows that arguments about debt and debt forgiveness have been at the center of political debates from Italy to China, as well as sparking innumerable insurrections. He also brilliantly demonstrates that the language of the ancient works of law and religion (words like ``guilt,'' ``sin,'' and ``redemption'') derive in large part from ancient debates about debt, and shape even our most basic ideas of right and wrong. We are still fighting these battles today without knowing it. Debt: The First 5,000 Years is a fascinating chronicle of this little known history---as well as how it has defined human history, and what it means for the credit crisis of the present day and the future of our economy. From the Hardcover edition.},

abstract = {International relations theorists tend to think in terms of continuous processes. Yet we observe only discrete events, such as wars or alliances, and summarize them in terms of the frequency of occurrence. As such, most empirical analyses in international relations are based on event count variables. Unfortunately, analysts have generally relied on statistical techniques that were designed for continuous data. This mismatch between theory and method has caused bias, inefficiency, and numerous inconsistencies in both theoretical arguments and empirical findings throughout the literature. This article develops a much more powerful approach to modeling and statistical analysis based explicitly on estimating continuous processes from observed event counts. To demonstrate this class of models, I present several new statistical techniques developed for and applied to different areas of international relations. These include the influence of international alliances on the outbreak of war, the contagious process of multilateral economic sanctions, and reciprocity in superpower conflict. I also show how one can extract considerably more information from existing data and relate substantive theory to empirical analyses more explicitly with this approach.},

These issues come to the fore in the light of the intensive deployment of particular rhetorics of globalization and European integration within policy-making, journalistic and corporate communities. This paper seeks to contribute to the development of an institutionalist and yet social constructivist understanding of the appeal to external economic constraints (such as globalization and European integration) within contemporary European public policy and political economy. Through an attempt first to map the range of discourses of globalization and European integration in contemporary Europe and then to chart the (frequently) strategic deployment of such discourses in Britain, France, Germany and Italy, the paper attempts to move beyond an understanding of globalization discourse as the linguistic expression of exogenous interests.

Consensual political institutions also affect welfare expenditures and decommodification positively, while majoritarian systems tend to depress them. Thus, competitive veto points tightly restrain governmental action, while collective veto points enable government.},

We argue that Mexico's liberalization of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in the 1990s provides a natural experiment to test how FDI affects income inequality in a middle-income country. We use an instrumental variables approach as our identification strategy to mitigate problems of endogeneity and omitted variable bias. In an empirical test of the determinants of changes in income inequality from 1990 to 2000, we find that increased FDI inflows are associated with a decrease in income inequality within Mexico's thirty-two states.},

I attribute such nonfindings in part to carelessness regarding the inferential consequences of measurement error and in part to limitations of research design. In an analysis of opinion change during the 1980 presidential campaign, adjusting for measurement error produces several strong media exposure effects, especially for network television news. Adjusting for measurement error also makes preexisting opinions look much more stable, suggesting that the new information absorbed via media exposure must be about three times as distinctive as has generally been supposed in order to account for observed patterns of opinion change.},

External and domestic influences on the government's decision to abandon its broadcasting monopoly are examined. The politics of broadcast deregulation and reform are analyzed. Special attention is devoted to processes leading to the introduction of commercial broadcasting and a national television service. It is argued that for media to play democracy-nurturing roles, workers must be empowered with adequate resources, training, experience, and professionalism.},

We hypothesize that the individual's ability and desire to exercise selective exposure is a key factor in determining whether a given source produces exposure to dissimilar views. Although a lack of diverse perspectives is a common complaint against American news media, we find that individuals are exposed to far more dissimilar political views via news media than through interpersonal political discussants. The media advantage is rooted in the relative difficulty of selectively exposing oneself to those sources of information, as well as the lesser desire to do so, given the impersonal nature of mass media.},

abstract = {This paper considers estimation and testing of vector autoregression coefficients in panel data, and applies the techniques to analyze the dynamic relationships between wages and hours worked in two samples of American males. The model allows for nonstationary individual effects, and is estimated by applying instrumental variables to the quasi-differenced autoregressive equations. Particular attention is paid to specifying lag lengths, forming convenient test statistics, and testing for the presence of measurement error. The empirical results suggest the absence of lagged hours in the wage of forecasting equation. Our results also show that lagged hours is important in the hours equation, which is consistent with alternatives to the simple labor supply model that allow for costly hours adjustment or preferences that are not time separable.},

abstract = {Transition path sampling has been established as a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of rare events. The trajectory generation moves of this Monte Carlo procedure, shooting moves and shifting modes, were developed primarily for rate constant calculations, although this method has been more extensively used to study the dynamics of reactive processes. We have devised and implemented three alternative trajectory generation moves for use with transition path sampling. The centering-shooting move incorporates a shifting move into a shooting move, which centers the transition period in the middle of the trajectory, eliminating the need for shifting moves and generating an ensemble where the transition event consistently occurs near the middle of the trajectory. We have also developed varied-perturbation size shooting moves, wherein smaller perturbations are made if the shooting point is far from the transition event. The trajectories generated using these moves decorrelate significantly faster than with conventional, constant sized perturbations. This results in an increase in the statistical efficiency by a factor of 2.5-5 when compared to the conventional shooting algorithm. On the other hand, the new algorithm breaks detailed balance and introduces a small bias in the transition time distribution. We have developed a modification of this varied-perturbation size shooting algorithm that preserves detailed balance, albeit at the cost of decreased sampling efficiency. Both varied-perturbation size shooting algorithms are found to have improved sampling efficiency when compared to the original constant perturbation size shooting algorithm.},

abstract = {While democratization is often seen as a national-level process, we argue that there is important scope for local effects. Through analysis of Mexican public opinion data collected on the eve of that country's historic 2000 elections, we demonstrate that local context greatly affects evaluations of the legitimacy of the system, and these evaluations, in turn, help to shape the willingness of citizens to engage with the system. Citizens are more willing to participate in politics if they think the process is fair, and direct evidence of the fairness of the system is provided by the local political context. This local connection, then, becomes critical in the process of individuals becoming, in Almond and Verba's classic term, "participatory" citizens (1963).},

Concentrating on the years 1979--1985, the impact of human rights conditions on both economic and military aid allocations to Latin America is analyzed. The results of this analysis indicate that though other factors have a significant effect upon aid allocation, human rights are an important factor in determining the allocation of both U.S. economic assistance and U.S. military assistance. The findings suggest that those countries with better human rights conditions are likely to receive more U.S. aid than others.},

We impose intellectual discipline by requiring that actors behave rationally using available information and that basic economic relationschips such as budget constraints be accounted for. We attempt to integrate two approaches, one based on dynamic games played by interest groups, with one that focus on limited information and the dynamic of learning. We describe the "starting point" as the set of "old" policies and we attempt to explain the dynamics (political, economic and informational) that lead to reform (section II). We analyze strategies for reformers subject to political constraints (section III). We evaluate the aggregate and distributional costs of reforms, emphasizing the importance of looking at the right counterfactuals (section IV). We conclude by pointing to the challenges ahead: the second-stage institutional reforms necessary to take off from underdevelopment.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

Attempts are being made, therefore, to funnel these resources away from nondemocratic governments and toward their citizens. Using formal analysis and building on existing theories of democratization, I analyze the effects of such institutional solutions when they function perfectly (the best-case scenario). The models show that even with institutional safeguards, these resources diminish chances for democratization. In addition to their practical importance, the results have an important theoretical implication: the political resource curse may not be due to dictators' use of these resources, but simply to their existence in nondemocracies.},

abstract = {The thesis that 'Capitalism does not just happen' is argued with reference to Gramsci, hegemony and the critique of state centrism. This involves a critique of the assumption that ruling classes rule effortlessly, and raises the issue: Does globalization increase the pressures on ruling classes to deliver? Global system theory is outlined in terms of transnational practices in the economic, political, and culture and ideology spheres and the characteristic institutional forms of these, the transnational corporation, transnational capitalist class and the culture-ideology of consumerism. The transnational capitalist class is organized in four overlapping fractions: TNC executives, globalizing bureaucrats, politicians and professionals, consumerist elites (merchants and media). Social movements for global capitalism and elite social movement organizations (ESMOs) are analysed. Each of the four fractions of the TCC has its own distinctive organizations, some of which take on social movement-like characteristics.},

title = {{Talking to Men About Rape}},
journal = {Out!},
year = {1984},
volume = {2},
month = apr,
annote = {<b>then you had better understand that the root issue here has to do with male supremacy and the control of women; sexual access to women; women as reproductive slaves; private ownership of women. That is the program of the Right. That is the morality they talk about. That is what they mean. That is what they want. And the only opposition to them that matters is an opposition to men owning women.

As a way of practicing equality, some vague idea about giving up power is useless. Some men have vague thoughts about a future in which men are going to give up power or an individual man is going to give up some kind of privilege that he has. That is not what equality means either.
I want to see this men's movement make a commitment to ending rape because that is the only meaningful commitment to equality. It is astonishing that in all our worlds of feminism and antisexism we never talk seriously about ending rape. Ending it. Stopping it. No more. No more rape. In the back of our minds, are we holding on to its inevitability as the last preserve of the biological? Do we think that it is always going to exist no matter what we do? All of our political actions are lies if we don't make a commitment to ending the practice of rape. This commitment has to be political. It has to be serious. It has to be systematic. It has to be public. It can't be self-indulgent.
Ending homophobia is worth doing. But you can't do it in a world with rape.

else could you possibly be here to do? What else could this movement possibly mean? What else could matter so much?
And on that day, that day of truce, that day when not one woman is raped, we will begin the real practice of equality, because we can't begin it before that day. Before that day it means nothing because it is nothing: it is not real; it is not true. But on that day it becomes real. And then, instead of rape we will for the first time in our lives--both men and women--begin to experience freedom.
If you have a conception of freedom that includes the existence of rape, you are wrong. You cannot change what you say you want to change. For myself, I want to experience just one day of real freedom before I die. I leave you here to do that for me and for the women whom you say you love.</b>},

abstract = {Does globalization affect perceptions of policy maker competence? Despite considerable attention to connections between globalization and policy efficacy, no research explores connections between the world economy and confidence in politicians. This article makes three novel arguments. First, by constraining administrative control over policy outcomes, economic globalization reduces levels of public confidence in national executives. Second, by signaling a more complex policy-making environment, exposure to world markets increases the volatility of policy maker evaluations. And third, economic openness affects public preferences over policy by shifting policy demands-away from domains constrained by market liberalization and toward areas where national autonomy remains strong. Time-series analyses of public opinion data from France support research expectations. As the first study to link economic globalization to policy perceptions, this article finds that the political consequences of engaging the global economy are more numerous than previously implied.},

abstract = {Groundbreaking essays on the new global economy from an "expert observer" (Forecast). Saskia Sassen is an internationally recognized expert on globalization whose writings have appeared in journals and magazines worldwide. Now available in paperback, Globalization and Its Discontents is a collection of Sassen's essays dealing with topics such as the "global city," gender and migration (reconceived as the globalization of labor), information technology, and the new dynamics of inequality. Sassen brings together cultural and literary studies, feminist theory, political economics, sociology, and political science, showing how vast the chasm between metropolitan business centers and low-income inner cities has become. Incisive and original, she takes on common political, cultural, and economic misconceptions of globalization and offers a thoughtful, provocative new look at our increasingly global society.},

Hypotheses: Lichbach (1987) hypothesizes that dissidents will substitute violent protest for nonviolent protest behavior (and vice versa) when confronted with repression. Gupta, Singh, and Sprague (1993) put forth a contextual argument: repression spurs violence in democracies, but high levels of repression are effective in authoritarian regimes. Rasler (1996) contends that timing matters: repression is effective in the short run, but spurs protest in the long run. Methods: Sequential tests of events data are used to test the hypotheses. Results: Lichbach's theory is supported by the evidence, but neither Gupta, Singh, and Sprague's nor Rasler's theories receives support.},

It considers the association between the expansion of shrimp farms and enhanced social conflict and the emergence of local resistance movements of the poor. It describes the globalization of shrimp mariculture, discusses its repercussions in Asia and Latin America, and explores its recent expansion in Central America. It reveals a number of factors that affect rural livelihoods, impinge on small farmers, and hurt the rural poor, and suggests that the industry may be intensifying the social and ecological crises associated with commodities promoted earlier. It raises serious concerns regarding equity, increased marginalization of the rural poor, and the further destruction of Central America's biophysical environment and natural resource base. Finally, it proposes changes in policy necessary to bring about more equitable and susta...},

The findings verify that the dominant type of Granger-causality is bidirectional. In instances that we found one-way causality, the pattern is not homogenous: Our analyses show that one-way causality generally runs from income to health in low- and middle-income countries whereas the reverse holds for high-income countries. Accordingly, care must be paid in defining the dependent and independent variables when specifying the determinants of health care expenditure.},

This article focuses on the process of representation through which political violence comes to be interpreted in the symbolic terms of culture and religion. Criticizing Orientalist notions that ascribe certain violent mentalities and practices to religious or ethnic groups in an essentialist manner, I argue that (self-)representations of sublime violence are nonetheless important to analyze for their an escalating effect on the political conflict. By examining the ways in which religious and ethnicized traditions of solidarity, justice and sacrifice have framed the representation of political violence in Sindh, I explore the interplay between the media, intelligence agencies of various state authorities, as well as political parties and their militants, focusing o...},

abstract = { Amelia II is a complete R package for multiple imputation of missing data. The package implements a new expectation-maximization with bootstrapping algorithm that works faster, with larger numbers of variables, and is far easier to use, than various Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches, but gives essentially the same answers. The program also improves imputation models by allowing researchers to put Bayesian priors on individual cell values, thereby including a great deal of potentially valuable and extensive information. It also includes features to accurately impute cross-sectional datasets, individual time series, or sets of time series for different cross-sections. A full set of graphical diagnostics are also available. The program is easy to use, and the simplicity of the algorithm makes it far more robust; both a simple command line and extensive graphical user interface are included.},
